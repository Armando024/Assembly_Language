# An algorithmic calender in assembly language.

## Why constructed?
  It's very important and useful to understand what happens at the low level of programming. 
  This become important when dealing with optimization problems. Such as problems that required
  the manipulation of big data. 
  
## How it was constructed?
  First: was figuring out how to write a single digit to a space.

  Second: Afterwards was to create a loop that increase the number and coordinate.
      looping: increase date number 
               increase coordinate 
               print to that coordinate
               repeat looping

  Third: The rest was dealing with dates and leap years which just became more of a flow control.

 ## How to run?
    You can run it using it emu8086 or used vim like i did.

    You can also used TASM which can be found in the internet.
